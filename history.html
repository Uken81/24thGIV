                <p>By early 1863, William T. Wofford, colonel of the 18th Georgia, was promoted and assumed command of
                    Cobb’s Brigade which became known as Wofford’s Brigade. The brigade moved with the Army of Northern
                    Virginia out of winter camp on the outskirts of Fredericksburg to meet the advancing Army of the
                    Potomac that spring. They engaged the army outside of Chancellorsville, Virginia (May 1-4) and
                    triumphed. Turning north the Army of Northern Virginia marched up the Shenandoah Valley through
                    Maryland and into Pennsylvania, where they fought on the farmlands around and town streets of
                    Gettysburg (July 1-3). On July 2nd, the 24th, part of McLaw’s Division, fought through the Peach
                    Orchard and Wheat Field before the assault of their brigade was halted because of night fall.</p>

                <p>Soon after being mustered into Confederate service the regiment was moved to Lynchburg, Virginia.
                    Within a week of arriving there, however, it was ordered to Goldsborough, North Carolina. There it
                    joined the Department of North Carolina. The unit remained there until early in 1862. Returning to
                    Virginia, the unit was placed in the Army of Northern Virginia. It served in that army until the
                    summer of 1863. At that time it was moved to Georgia where it served in the Army of Tennessee. It
                    next saw service in the Department of East Tennessee. In the spring of 1864 the regiment returned to
                    the Army of Northern Virginia, remaining in that army until mid-summer 1864. It then moved to the
                    Shenandoah Valley where it served in the Army of the Valley District. Finally, in December 1864, the
                    unit returned to the Army of Northern Virginia, serving in that army for the remainder of the war.
